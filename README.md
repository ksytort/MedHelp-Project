Project

Medication help app

The idea of my project is to help close people to remind and control the medication.

 1.Create an account from one or more people. The main one (who takes medication) the rest are additional for viewing and editing.Ð¡onnect all accounts.*everyone should have an app

 2.Find all the medicines to take. 
  In additional options, enter the dose of the drug (in tablets, liquids, etc.)

 3.For each drug, mark the day, time and frequency on the calendar.

 4.The main account receives reminders and notes about taking the medication, and the connected accounts can check the appointment calendar and, if necessary, remind again
